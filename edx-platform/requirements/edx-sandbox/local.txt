# DON'T JUST ADD NEW DEPENDENCIES!!!
#
# If you open a pull request that adds a new dependency, you should notify:
#   * @edx/ospr - to check licensing
#   * @edx/devops - to check system requirements

# Install these packages from the edx-platform working tree
# NOTE: if you change code in these packages, you MUST change the version
# number in its setup.py or the code WILL NOT be installed during deploy.
